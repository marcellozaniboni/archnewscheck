# archnewscheck
A very simple command line tool that prints the titles of the last arch news. Useful before updating an Arch Linux installation, to check if manual intervention is needed.

## building
Just run `build-linux.sh` to build the executable.

## use
Just execute `archnewscheck` to print the list of the latest news. If you want to be prompted to open the defaul web browser, execute it in interactive mode using "i" parameter: `archnewscheck i`.
