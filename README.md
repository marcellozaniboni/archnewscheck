# archnewscheck
A very simple command line tool that prints the titles of the latest arch news. Useful before updating an Arch Linux installation, to check if manual intervention is needed.

## implementations
There are two alternative implementations: one in Bash and one in Go. The Go implementation is older and is no longer maintained. Therefore, I recommend using the Bash implementation.

## use
Run this command before updating your Arch system: it will display the latest news by reading it directly from the RSS feed.
